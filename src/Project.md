## manifest.json

It is a very important file that every extension have. In this file we keep the
metadata about the extension like the name of the extension, its version, all
the permissions that the extension requires etc.

You can find the manifest.json in src/manifest.json. In the file we have
defined:

- **browser_action :** It is the button/icon that your browser displays at the
  toolbar.

  - default_title : It is a tooltip for the button

  - deafult_popup : Here you declare the path to the popup file. The file is a
    HTML file.

- **description :** A small desciption about the extension.

- **manifest_version :** It defines the version of the manifest file that the
  extension uses. Currently, this always needs to be 2.

- **version :** The current version of the extension.

  - page : Path to the options.html file, where the user can change the
    preferences for the extension.

- **permissions :** All the permissions that your extension will require to work
  smoothly. It is an array of strings.

- **background :** Here you can define the background scripts that needs to
  maintain a long-term state.

  - scripts : The scripts that will load when the extension is enabled/loaded
    and will remain loaded untill the extension is removed or disabled.
